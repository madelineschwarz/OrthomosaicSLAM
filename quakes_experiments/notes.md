Challenges: 
-cameras are oriented at angles
-cameras have slightly different image coloration (for early experimental flights)
-Georeferencing information is lost when mosaic is generated (output orthoimage is not georeferenced)
-Mosaicking works with images from the same camera
-Limited number of images you can stitch at at time (out of the box, around 20)
-Mosaic has black borders where NDV

TODOs:
-Maintain georeferencing (?)
-Remove black border
-explore issue of camera angles (designed for single camera facing vertically down)
